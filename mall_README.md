# K-Means-Clustering-Using-ML
Thrilled to share my latest project where I utilized machine learning to create customer clusters in a mall shopping dataset. Employing the K-means algorithm, I successfully segmented customers based on their earnings and spending rates, enabling targeted marketing strategies. This project not only enhanced my understanding of unsupervised learning but also provided actionable insights for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing efforts. Excited to continue exploring the intersection of data science and business strategy in future endeavors!
